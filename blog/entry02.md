I have decided that my game will be an endless runner but its going to be easier than other runners in the sense that you will have a health system a double jump and potentially a fast fall. I think that having 3 hits will be fair before you are forced to restart.
        sprite("bean"),
        pos(80, 40),
        area(),
        body(),
        health(3)
I figured out how to implement the health system as well as change the position of where the character can be, pos can be use to alter the x and y coordinate of the sprite and health is used for, well i think its pretty obvious.
    onKeyPress("space", jump);
    onClick(jump);
I have now learned how to add a jump to my game, the only issue is that i dont know how to add a limit to the jumps i can do but that might not be a bad thing Iif i can make massive pits in some spots and add obstacles to the ceiling.
