My freedom project was ideally just going to be remaking any basic runner type game.
but now im just going to try and remake flappy bird after seeing how my attempt at a double jump led to my character being able to fly just like in flappy bird.

the code for this however has been troublesome. sometimes the bean wont spawn, other times I just cant move, sounds wont load in, the game over screen wont appear. I believe that getting rid of the sounds might fix this issue.

update: got rid of the sounds and now everything works, i might have written the code for the sounds wrong and that was messing up everything else. loadSound("wooosh", "/examples/sounds/wooosh.mp3") had something wrong about it and untill i figure it out the game just wont have any sound. I think ill start working on the health system next.

update: screw the health system, im just gonna work on changing the sprite, the health system is now an after thought. I tried making the sprite shown be mordecai from the regular show, nothing works now. So i managed to fix the issues with some help, now mordecai spawns in but he takes up the entire screen and dies instantly. i just replaced anything that used to say "bean" with "mordecai" or "mordecai.png".
