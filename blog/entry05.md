# Entry 5
##### 4/15/24

Right now my main goal is just to add cosmetic features to the game, such as dynamic colors for the obstacles and different backgrounds, and potentially, if I have time, health pickups. step one should be the background.

Ive now taken care of the background I can freely change the background but it isn't as dynamic as id hoped, still it does work and I can change it whenever I please
